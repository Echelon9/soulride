HOWTO MAKE A WIN32 INSTALLER FOR SOULRIDE
=========================================

Directory layout.  $(SRC) could be anything, e.g. "c:/mysrc".

    $(SRC)/soulride             contains GPL'd Soul Ride engine source
    $(SRC)/soulride-private     contains your specific terrain data files

Key files that must be available:

    $(SRC)/soulride/src/Release/soulride.exe   built from source using GNU make & MSVC
    $(SRC)/soulride/src/installer/*            scripts and file lists (.lst) for the install
    $(SRC)/soulride-private/*                  files referred to by the .lst files

Getting the source:

    If you need the source code and/or the installer scripts, you can
    retrieve it from SourceForge via anonymous CVS, with:

    # cd $(SRC)
    # cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/soulride login
    # cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/soulride co soulride

    If you have commit access to the project on SourceForge, you can
    (and should) use cvs via SSH.  See SourceForge docs.

Extra tools:

    If you're going to build from source, you need:

      GNU make

      Microsoft Visual C/C++ (versions 6 or 7 should both work)

    You make also need a bash-compatible shell.  I use cygwin as a
    build environment; cygwin includes CVS as well.  Get cygwin from
    http://www.cygwin.com/

    To make the installer, you need:

      Perl (I use the one included with cygwin, but the ActiveState
      version will probably work as well,
      http://www.activestate.com/).

      Nullsoft Scriptable Install System ("NSIS"); get it from
      http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ .  The soulride installer scripts
      use Version 2.0 as of 5/21/2004.  Download it and install it to

        c:/Program Files/NSIS

Building from source:

    If you already have a valid soulride.exe that you want to use, and
    are just changing data files, you don't have to do this.  Just
    make sure the soulride.exe you want to use is located at
    $(SRC)/soulride/src/Release/soulride.exe

    Otherwise, to build from source, do this:

    # cd $(SRC)/soulride/src
    # make clean
    # make

    There will be a few compile and link warnings.  If everything
    worked, there should be a new soulride.exe in
    $(SRC)/soulride/src/Release

Testing:

    To test with your data, do:

    # cd $(SRC)/soulride-private
    # ../soulride/soulride.exe

    You can add command-line options to soulride as needed.

To build the installer:

    After you've tested to make sure everything works, do this:

    # cd $(SRC)/soulride/src/installer
    # make soulride_setup

    This should generate a self-installing Windows executable, in the
    file soulride_setup_$(VERSION).exe

    $(VERSION) is defined in $(SRC)/soulride/src/config.mak; make sure
    it's up to date.  Note that the version number is compiled into
    the soulride.exe program, so you must rebuild from source in order
    for the soulride launcher to show an updated version number.

    Test the installer by running it.  If you install Soul Ride, and
    discover that files are missing when you run it, check the file
    lists in $(SRC)/soulride/src/installer/$(MOUNTAIN_NAME).lst
