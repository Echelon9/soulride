To compile a player from scratch, use:

gamegui.cpp
gg_actor.cpp
gg_event.cpp
gg_file.cpp
gg_font.cpp
gg_movie_impl.cpp
gg_player_impl.cpp
gg_psdread.cpp
gg_resource.cpp
gg_script.cpp
gg_string.cpp
gg_log.c

gg_audio.cpp            [used to build standalone ggplayer.exe]
winmain.cpp             [used to build standalone ggplayer.exe]
winmain_hittest.cpp     [used to build hittest.exe]
winmain_fonttest.cpp    [used to build fonttest.exe]

-------------------------

To use the library in an app, simply add the gamegui.lib file into your project, and include the header file "gamegui.h".
