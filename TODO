TODO list for the Soul Ride Engine

bugs/maintenance
================

* Better error messages on missing content!!!

* Crank warning level and fix warnings

* Add asserts to flush out bugs

* Fix Linux bugs

  * stutter in framerate

  * failure loading retail data, and Virtual Stratton?

  * mouse gets off-center after some amount of play

* Better sample data

* Improve data tools

* slider for total terrain texture cache size (currently it's fixed)

* make the terrain performance scale better to higher perf machines
  (mainly a question of increasing the cache sizes and tile build
  limits when the machine can handle it)

wish list/features
==================

* better customizability for the rider, with a real UI

* goofy stance

* finish nose/tail grab implementation

* grinds

* heli-drop "bookmarks"/landmarks

* real camera controls for VCR

* easy screenshot interface for VCR

* AVI/Quicktime/MPG export for movies

* snow trail

* "ghost rider" (patented by Midway, bleah, need a workaround)

* career mode

* real UI option for "Jet Power", and maybe put up a little icon when
  it is enabled

* Try some level designs where the player has to grab certain objects
  on the way down (a la Elastomania)

* "Arcade" style physics, as a more easily playable alternative

* In-game editor: I think this is the generic solution to many of the
  current tool woes.  Basically, cook up some code so that the engine
  can export a valid .srt based on its current state.  Then, gradually
  add in-game editor features in order of payoff.  Maintain
  compatibility with existing out-of-game tools.

* lighting for objects

* better boarder vs world collision detection (use swept spheres
  instead of cylinder?  Allow boarding on poly objects?)

* animated world objects?

* better looking trees, w/ some kind of LOD

* virtual GPS (encode the level center's real-world UTM coords),
  readout in lat-lon or UTM

* other vehicles

  * "hike" and "climb" modes

  * pilot the helicopter for helidrops, for real

  * ride a mountain bike through the backcountry

  * drive a pick-up truck between resorts

  * snowmobile

  * Veloci

  * etc.

* mp3 playlists for music

* remappable controls

* replace gamegui with gameswf library

Ports
=====

* Macintosh

* Dreamcast?  PS2 Linux kit?  Xbox Linux?
